# Hi, I'm Arthur,

I write code in my free time as a hobby. Thats basically all I have to say here.

### Current Projects
[**The WAN Database**](https://github.com/TheWANDatabase/) - A comprehensive archive of all things related to the semi-popular weekly tech podcast "The WAN Show" produced by Linus Media Group.

**WAN Show Bingo** - I am apparently an active contributor to someone else's project relating to the show, I often stop by and help provide live bingo tile coverage (when I am able to)

Former data librarian for [Launch Library 2](https://thespacedevs.com/llapi) at [TheSpaceDevs](https://github.com/TheSpaceDevs).
